About this project
----

The following codes when uploaded to a microcontroller unit (MCU) are able to measure the distance (in RSSI) between a central node and a peripheral node, in which, each node is a microcontroller that is able to use the Bluetooth protocol and output the distance (RSSI) on an LCD I2C Screen.
Both of the following codes were compiled on the Arduino IDE version 2.0.3.

The codes are compatible and have been tested on for the folowing boards:



-ESP32 Dev Kit


-ESP32-C3


-ARDUINO NANO BLE SENSE


-ARDUINO NANO 33 IOT
